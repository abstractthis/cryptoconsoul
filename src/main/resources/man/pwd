       pwd
       

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the absolute path to the directory in which CryptoConsoul is
       launched. Equivalent to System.getProperty("user.dir"). The intent
       is to provide a quick way for users to provide file paths if the
       user decides to drop target files into the CryptoConsoul directory.
